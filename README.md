which is a package of Java classes for multivariate and univariate polynomials over the rings: Z(integers), Q (rational numbers), R (real numbers), C (complex numbers), F_2 (field of two elements), Cyclotomic Number Fields, and more. Also supported are modular rings K[X]/f(X) for a ring K and a polynomial f and Quotient Fields over rings. There are also classes for implementing universal rings. 
Note that this is an old coding project from me published ages ago at http://ring.perisic.com This is now moved to GitHub
